    <h2>I believe in...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lifelong Learning: </strong>I believe that there is no pinnacle of success and learning. Intelligent people know how much they don't know.</li>
        <li><strong>The Path to Success isn't Linear: </strong>When imagining success, you probably imagine a straight graph going up, however this is almost never the case.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on the Root Cause: </strong>When pitching a product, the best way to get investors interested is elaborating on the problem to show the magnitude of opportunity.</li>
    </ul>
